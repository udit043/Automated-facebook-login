# Automated-facebook-login

I have created a project for automatic facebook login and idea behind this project is to create secure login tool for various sites.
I have used sendKeyDown and sendKeyUp functions here because keylogger fails to intercept characters entered using this function.
You just need to enter ASCII number of your username & password in sendKeyDown and sendKeyUp parameter and then compile.
